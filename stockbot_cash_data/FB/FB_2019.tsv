2019-01-26	More and more, it’s clear that one profit-driven platform that connects all of the world’s people to all of the world’s information — the vision Zuckerberg has long had for Facebook— is a terminally-flawed idea.
2019-01-26	Yesterday, we published that Mark aspired to re-create AOL Instant Messenger: "In keeping with Mark’s interest in building a better AIM, WhatsApp, Instagram and Oculus are helping to fuel the company’s growth." Today, this from @MikeIsaac. https://nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-messenger.html…
2019-01-26	It really does seem that $FB issued its wild response exclusively through the Kremlin's mouthpiece. Breathtaking. Especially because Facebook does NOT file fake account estimates with the SEC every quarter. It stopped doing that in Q4 2017. It says so in their own SEC Form 10-K!
2019-01-26	Embedded in an RT article that we will not link to is $FB's official response to our report: "This report is completely wrong and not based on any facts or research. This is unequivocally wrong and responsible reporting means reporting facts, even if it’s about fake accounts."

2019-03-16	Your Weekend Reading: Mark Zuckerberg just had an exceptionally bad week
2019-03-16	$FB Extremely bearish reversal. If it loses 159 it could see mid-low 140s https://tradingview.com/x/SRDtfQxK/
2019-03-16	Facebook starting to underperform and weaken. $FB is down .81% the last 5 weeks, while $QQQ is up 5.81%. The stock is stalling around the downward sloping 40-week SMA and the 50% retracement. A 50% retracement is 1 step up after 2 steps down - typical for a counter-trend bounce.
2019-03-16	I used to think $FB was a good investment because the negative news cycle wasn't turning off users or advertisers. But Chris Cox, a 13 year veteran & friend of Zuckerberg, with all that inside knowledge deciding to eject is a foreboding sign. Like @sriramk leaving $SNAP pre-IPO

2019-06-12	If $FB is large part of your portfolio, you have to acknowledge the dependencies — that you planned to capitalize on the stupidity of those that remained on FB, and the ineptitude of Federal regulators. How else is one supposed to cash in without much effort?
2019-06-12	Developments around antitrust are making it even more unlikely $FB will ever find an acquisition that consumes a large amount of money (especially a deal that's anywhere close to their core business). The case for hoarding tens of billions of excess cash continues to weaken.

2019-06-18	Gold is loving $FB’s Libra’s attack on the $USD as world reserve currency. When it breaks $1,365, new ATH imminent.
2019-06-18	$FB claims that it will have no control over the "non-profit" that sits at the center of its crypto project. If you believe that I have a bridge to sell you.
2019-06-18	If your political leaders aren't commenting on $FB unveiling of #cryptocurrency #LIBRA, it's because they don't understand the 21st Century or how your #personaldata is being borrowed to create 100% of economic growth. #WeOweUS a #UniversalBasicIncome now, for #NY13 and all.
2019-06-18	I have never seen this before, but both Bitcoiners and nocoiners, both Republicans and Democrats, *literally everyone* agrees the $FB Libra coin is a dumb idea.
2019-06-18	I caught up with @HawleyMO about @facebook’s cryptocurrency: “Sounds like they’re expanding their monopoly,” he says. Would he trust $FB with his money? *laughs* “No. I don’t trust Facebook with anything.”

2019-06-18	Libra doesn’t compete with #Bitcoin. It competes with other fiat. It’s private currency vs. state currency. (The first time this has been possible globally via blockchain’ish tech). Let $FB take out banks/central banks leaving BTC free to grab Gold’s market as SOV.

2019-06-18	Here's me talking about Libra with @tomkeene this morning.
2019-06-18	Sovereign currencies are an inevitable part of our future If you're a government, would you rather have a truly decentralised currency to compete with fiat, or one that is controlled by the most powerful non-government entities of this world? What would you prefer? $FB $LIBRA
2019-06-18	Lots of people bought 200 $FB calls regarding the recent news. On the other hand, Cramer expects the ATH to be taken out. If this prophecy gets fulfilled, expect a new paradigm and a temporal rift.
2019-06-18	Early Tuesday morning, Facebook unveiled Libra, the name given a new digital currency designed to be used for the buying and selling of goods and services and other types of money transfers. $FB

2019-06-18	Facebook going full crypto unveiling its Libra coin and @markmahaney says it’s a watershed moment for the social media giant $FB
2019-06-18	Would you trust Facebook to handle your digital wallet? @BeckyQuick asks the head of the company's new digital currency Libra @davidmarcus about consumers trusting $FB with their sensitive financial information:
2019-06-18	It’s built into the protocol’s genesis block that eventually a heavyweight like $fb would take on BTC. This increased awareness and appeal to would-be potentates will, of course, drive the hashrate to new highs, leading to new ATH for BTC price. Zuck is Satoshi’s useful idiot.

2019-06-18	Facebook joins the #cryptocurrency world today with details on its Libra project. $FB and #Bitcoin have rallied in anticipation.
2019-06-18	It’s going to be fun to watch $FB eat the marketcaps of half of the @Libra Foundation members. Couldn’t help but chuckle, wolf inviting sheep for dinner. Bon appetit!
2019-06-18	$FB Libra is still tied to US Bonds. So, what if US bond's explode at some point??? It's a question you need to ask. $BTC is backed by nothing and only tied to the electrical work previously put in along with the future incentive's to continue the chain. Interesting times.
2019-06-18	What's funny is #bitcoin bulls are quick to say $FB Libra is an $XRP killer, which may be true given it should be highly competitive to *any* #crypto w/currency as a use-case, but also suggests we've given up on $btc as means of exchange? Should that not change its "valuation?"

2019-07-25	What to make of Facebook Earnings: Here's my thoughts $FB
2019-07-25	$FB was up +4% after hours yesterday. And... it’s.... gone....
2019-07-25	Easiest prediction of the day: every Halftime Report panel member sold $FB at the highs after hours last night. Watch and learn.
2019-07-25	+$824. Expected $FB to sell off this morning based on their guidance around privacy regulations impacting how they target consumers. All the PT upgrade shenanigans were just to get more retails to chase. $SOLY is working out real well on my swing account.
2019-07-25	It's happening. Everyone has the duty to do everything they can to shutdown significant threats to society.

2019-10-30	This is a very bullish, boss move by $TWTR. I know it sounds counterintuitive that turning away lucrative ad dollars is bullish. However, these paid political ads have had a corrosive effect on the credibility of all media platforms. $FB and $GOOG take heed.

2019-10-31	Wow! $FB is guiding for expenses to be around $56b next year? That would be a roughly 35% increase from 2019 numbers... Yowza This flies in the face of my theory that expense growth should moderate over time.
2019-10-31	$PINS * EPS: +0.01 vs -0.04 estimates * Revenue: $279.9M vs $280.6M +47% growth yoy, topping $FB 28% and $GOOGL 17%. * MAU: 322M vs 322.8M * ARPU: 90 cents vs 91 cents * 2019 full-year Revenue $1.1B - $1.115B vs $1.12B If you think that's worth a 20% haircut, sell.
2019-10-31	By my math, $FB trades at something like 10x - 12x P/E on 2023 earnings, at which point they will also hold about $40 per share in cash (FWIW, assume they spend 40% of FCF on repurchases going forward, with FCF equal to 65% of net income).
2019-10-31	This week in tech, $MSFT beats $AMZN in a big military cloud contract, $GOOG may buy $FIT for some unknown reason + more.

2019-12-24	Agreed. Takeaways for me: *Incubency tends to last quite a while (Yahoo & AOL’s dominance took much longer to fall away than I expected), but nothing is forever. *Very notable decline in FB of late, and spectacular decline in BIDU. *Once usage rolls over comebacks are rare.
2019-12-24	Worth watching closely. $GOOG is a robust monopoly that's still growing like mad. $FB shrinking fast and is subtly fragile. Network effect both creates and destroys value exponentially. The more people who quit, the less reason others have to get on. There's a feedback loop
