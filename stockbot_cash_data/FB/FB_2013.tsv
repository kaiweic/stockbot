2013-11-06	@tlmontana Thank you. I expect 26-45 range. My analysis/opinion on IPO ~$25 is that it is valued same/richer than $FB at IPO.
2013-11-06	Coming Up on #CNBC: @RandiZuckerberg, founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media, talks Twitter and Facebook with @carlquintanilla. • $TWTR $FB
2013-11-06	To give you an idea of relationship between $TWTR and $FB, Zuckerberg sold almost much $FB at $38 as the entire $TWTR IPO @cnbcfastmoney
2013-11-06	Where's the bubble? $TSLA 23% off highs. $TRLA 30% off highs. $Z 22% off highs. $NFLX 15% off highs. $YELP 12% off highs. $FB 11% off highs.
2013-11-06	you dumb momentum bulls, look at $tsla $fb & $nflx. Coming soon to $bby $ba $fdx and all the rest of these ridiculous stocks

2013-11-06	$TWTR I'm predicting some Static in the IPO Thursday..u no like a halt or it going above $40.00. Might stay away for awhile n buy $FB more!!
2013-11-06	I hope twitter becomes as good a trading vehicle that $FB is. $FB has rich IV and the liquidity in the derivatives is great.
