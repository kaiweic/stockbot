2018-08-18	So this caught my eye. See the 12 HR? Like $FB, indicator may be forming triangle. In my experience, when this happens near reversal zone, there will be a bigger Reset to the opposite zone. Last example I saw on $NQ yielded a 300 pt drop $ES_F $ES $SPX $SPY $NQ $NQ_F $NDX $QQQ

2018-08-18	A crisis at $FB - clearly Zuckerberg is intending on liquidating a lot of his shares...he liquidated 1MM of his shares last week into the lows no less (but unlike this chart shows he still supposedly has over 400 million shares not 13 million - that’s for this particular class)
2018-08-18	$FB $TWTR $GOOGL are going to get spanked if they keep it up.
2018-08-18	2/3 It wasn't until after $FB's ER that I even looked at its charts bec I don't do indiv names, but after seeing this I might (for lotto plays). Note how Daily was in Nosebleed territory, as well as 12 HR w/ Neg Divg building. Then you see 6 HR & 4 HR coiling near reversal zone
2018-08-18	$FB Zuckerberg in tough spot. He got pressure by the establishment to stop “fake news”. He outsourced that task to the Atlantic Council which is basically the military industrial complex. They are shutting down any view they don’t like. Now regulation is coming. Total disaster.

2018-10-30	Update from $fb conference Call: 1: Q4 revenues are expected to decelerate by a mid to high single digit number (vs high single digit number previously). 2: Expenses and capex will grow less then expected in the last conference call. Prediction: we will see analysts upgrading

2018-10-30	Despite scandals & massive media bashing, Facebook users don’t give a shit: $fb
2018-10-30	Welp! $FB Guess earnings were not that hot
2018-10-30	$FB has $42B net in cash and generated $17.3B of free cash flow over the last four quarters.
2018-10-30	Here's everything you need to know about Facebook $FB on one giant earnings slide. Incredible recap from @_SeanDavid. See it here: https://stocktwits.com/SeanDavid/message/143327969…
2018-10-30	$FB +$18 in the last 30min, not sure what was said on the conf call:
2018-10-30	$amzn once up 24 on $fb.... now up 18 still
2018-10-30	Facebook Revenue (Billions)... 2018 (est): 55 2017: 41 2016: 28 2015: 18 2014: 12 2013: 7.9 2012: 5.1 2011: 3.7 2010: 2.0 Facebook Net Income (Billions)... 2018 (est): 21 2017: 16 2016: 10 2015: 3.7 2014: 2.9 2013: 1.5 2012: .05 2011: 1.0 2010: 0.6 $FB
2018-10-30	The most important long term $FB metric is DAU. "DAUs were 1.49 billion on average for September 2018, an increase of 9% year-over-year."
2018-10-30	Question for Facebook Q3 Call $FB: @pewresearch study stated 26% of Facebook users had deleted the app from their phones, but you reported flat US daily active users (DAUs) at 185 million and globally up 1.6% to 1.495 billion – where is the disconnect? http://pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/09/05/americans-are-changing-their-relationship-with-facebook/…
2018-10-30	BTW the market doesn't need good #'s from $FB and $AAPL; it needs to rally on bad numbers. $SPX $NDX
2018-10-30	Am I the only one who finds constant 66% DAUs/MAUs ratio during the last 2 years suspicious? Just saying $FB $TWTR $SNAP
2018-10-30	Facebook Inc $FB Q3 Earnings Per Share $1.76 vs. $1.47 expected
2018-10-30	Take a look at the different markets https://goo.gl/3r8w5M utilize this chart to compare them! $FB $TWTR
2018-10-30	$FB ahs earnings trades. I only trade ahs small but still caught most the move. Then the headfake pull stopped me out. But I couldn't let the trade go red on me.
2018-10-30	What's very clear: Stories is the future of Facebook, Zuck and others are saying again and again Stories will be bigger than News Feed, which also (again) highlights just how effective they've been at crushing Snapchat (my take from earlier this year: https://mashable.com/2018/05/02/facebook-stories-crushing-snapchat/…) $FB
2018-10-30	$FB trading like Eli Manning afterhours... has no idea where it wants to go

2018-10-30	$FB Monthly (updated) - tgt hit and I’m flipping for a small attempt...
2018-10-30	So we are two minutes into $FB's earnings call and Mark Zuckerberg has name dropped two competitors already. Just said “We’re well behind YouTube” in regards to Facebook Watch, and pointed out that Apple's iMessage is their biggest competitor on messaging. That's rare.
2018-10-30	Basically, 3 out of every 10 people on the planet is on Facebook. That's a whole lot of eyeballs to monetize. $FB
2018-10-30	$FB down 3% after hours
2018-10-30	$FB Reports Q3 Daily Active Users Up 9% YoY
2018-10-30	Mark Zuckerberg walking into $FB conference call knowing he's been unloading shares from the top

2018-10-30	Facebook Reports September Daily Active Users Up 9% YoY $FB https://pro.benzinga.com @benzinga
2018-10-30	LOL!!! Look at $FB in after-hours.... market has no idea what to think... every turn in price is a reaction to a key sentence on the conference call. What a circus.
2018-10-30	New article on $FB earnings "Facebook's user growth is starting to slow and this is the most important number for investors to look at due to the virality of social networks." https://seekingalpha.com/article/4215832-everyone-know-facebooks-q3-earnings-call… #stocks #facebook #earnings @Lee_Saks @davidmarcus @psk2329 @tradebeautiful
2018-10-30	Facebook Earnings: $FB $13.7B revenue, up 33% Operating margin 42% 2.27B monthly active users, up 10% y/y (up all regions) 1.49B daily active users, up 9% y/y 33,606 employees, up 45% 19.4% R&D budget $7.5B operating cash flow APRU growth in all regions, led by Asia & Europe
2018-10-30	Some levels on $FB Downside targets of course ..
2018-10-30	First question for Zuck: what if people don't like Stories on Facebook? Zuck says the first version wasn't as high quality as it should have been, but he's not worried now bc "it's growing" $FB
2018-10-30	Nice Broadening Formation ya got there $FB

2018-10-30	$FB earnings call $146--->$139--->$150--->$137--->$154 so far... People not nervous at all about that one. 
2018-10-30	time for that pre-close coffee & square to mentally prepare myself to watch my $fb options evaporate
2018-10-30	$FB MAU and DAUs are just shy of consensus. 2.27b MAU vs 2.29b.. with “engagement” at 65.8% means this was a solid quarter for KPIs. Those scary user anecdotes ahead of earnings weren’t even close, lol.
2018-10-30	$FB Monthly (updated) - still south of support still a short for me...
2018-10-30	+$38,814 in profits in the after hours on the $FB earnings trade. Incorrect reaction by traders! Knowing the story, fears, and expectations is key so you're not reacting to irrationalities but rather executing on price.
2018-10-30	Facebook's earnings today after the close. $FB
2018-10-30	$FB turned positive, Dow going up 1,000 tomorrow
2018-10-30	It's just amazing that Mark Zuckerberg keeps talking about what a good job $FB is doing on its various measures to address extremism and meddling in elections when it seems like the new fascist President of Brazil used WhatsApp illegally to get elected.

2018-10-30	Mark Zuckerberg from today's $FB earnings call regarding messaging: "We are leading in most countries, but our biggest competitor by far is iMessage." Zuck looking at Spiegel right now like...
2018-10-30	Facebook CC Takeway: $FB 1. Users didn't leave 2. Advertisers didn't leave 3. Clear monetization. Stories, SHOPPING, IGTV, Watch 4. CAPEX roadmap clearing up. (~2019) 5. Getting grip on security 6. Margin stability likely late 2019 7. Comparing now to shifting from web to mobile
2018-10-30	Regardless what you think about $FB or analysts projections, these numbers are downright mind boggling.
