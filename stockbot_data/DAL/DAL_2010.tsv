2010-12-26	#delta airlines is a complete disaster time and time again. Damn me and my cheap ways for booking through them!
2010-12-26	#FML All flights into #NYC are cancelled... Merry Xmas mother nature and fuck you #delta airlines
2010-12-26	Let me get this straight. There's very little snow either here or in Baltimore. For this #Delta & #Continental canceled flights?
2010-12-26	Hey #delta, when we miss our flight because of your incompetence, we'll remember it. Give me Virgin America any day.
2010-12-26	I cannot believe this - there is a confirmed affiliate flight leaving TODAY on #delta from JFK to IST. And they cancelled my flight. wtf.
2010-12-26	In the spirit of Kwanzaa I'm going to keep the peace #delta
2010-12-26	Whew, ran thru 2 #Delta terminals in #Atlanta under 10min to gate by a hair, they'd given away my original seat even--Hope bag made it too!
2010-12-26	#Delta can't give me back 1/2 Thxgiving they stole w/o much consideration/compensation. Plane & pilot shortages are not weather related!
2010-12-26	All I know is #delta better get me on this plane to Venice before the snow starts falling
