2019-01-01	$MSFT settled +1.2% at $101.57. Despite back above psy'100, the stock is m/t broken with the main market. Arguably.. only bullish above upper trend in the 112s.
2019-01-01	Microsoft had an incredible year, for sure. It did what most people didn’t expect, which really confused its competitors and their red team scenario planners. $MSFT
2019-01-01	$SPX 2018 contributors: total return was -4.38%, contribution % are reversed due to the negative (return/neg base); $MSFT adds the most (up 20.8% for 2018, accounts for 5.8% of gain), then $AMZN (28.4%,5.1%), worst is $FB (-25.7%,-4.4%) [$AAPL (-5.4%, -1.2%)had 17 worst impact]
2019-01-01	This suggests to me that the cyclical single-stock short seller cap might be the best one to don over at least the next year. It's reasonable to assume that sector dispersion increases and markets trade sideways accordingly... Or hopefully up, pulled up by $MSFT (talks book).

2019-06-22	As do I. But that market's gone. I heard we toyed w/ acquiring Spotify but I think the question loomed: "How would $MSFT add value & grow Spotify? What is the long term potential upside of such an acquisition?" And of course, that's another matured market that's prolly peaked.

2019-09-07	I’ve used it and tried to get other teams/businesses to use it in my previous line of work. It was terrible (2018/2019). IMO Slack, Zoom, and unbundling other are a threat to the future of O365. That is all they are focused on. $MSFT has many other focuses

2019-09-07	Started buying $SHOP around $150-175. It is my biggest holding. Roku around $105- $128. $ZM around $85. $TTD was around $140. $MDB around $85. Whole idea for the question is to brainstorm companies under $50B. Valuation high right now.I also own $MSFT,$MA, $V etc in Portfolio.
2019-09-07	I also used to have a fairly large position in $MSFT but like many value investors, I sold when it wasn’t ridiculously cheap anymore. I was totally out by early 2012. Highest price ever realized was $32. Ugghhh.
2019-09-07	Notable inside week follow-up: $AMD tried up and back in range!!! $MSFT tried up for a point. $AAPL 4 points but a lot from the gap. $FB similar.
2019-09-07	With the distribution in place by $MSFT, they shouldn't be ignored. All existing Office 365 clients are converted and they are improving the product day by day. I wouldn't think Slack's growth stops but I don't think that their hyper growth can be continued. $WORK
